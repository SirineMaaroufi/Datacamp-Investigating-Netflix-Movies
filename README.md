# Datacamp-Investigating-Netflix-Movies
This project brought together my Python skills from Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to solve a fascinating real-world data science challenge. Curious about whether Netflix movies are getting shorter and eager to identify the standout guest stars in "**The Office'**s" most iconic episode, I embarked on this journey. Armed with techniques including **lists, loops**, **_pandas_**, and **_matplotlib_**, I delved into exploratory data analysis, mastering the manipulation of raw data and deriving valuable insights through custom visualizations.
